# cat_weight_tracker
a way to track the weights of my cats. may eventually be a webapp, for now just jupyter. 


## inputs
takes inputs of date (ISO 8601 standard) and weight (choose units, but currently need specification in plot labels)

## outputs
outputs three plots: one for each cat, and one combined with both cats plotted by the age they were in weeks, not by date.
